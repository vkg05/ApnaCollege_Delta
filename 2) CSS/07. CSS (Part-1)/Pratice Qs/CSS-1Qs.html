    <!-- Poem -->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
        Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
        Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cld command, <br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
        Noothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away." <br>
